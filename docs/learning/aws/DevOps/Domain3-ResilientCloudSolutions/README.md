**Domain 3: Resilient Cloud Solutions**

### Task Statement 3.1: Implement highly available solutions to meet resilience and
business requirements.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Multi-AZ and multi-Region deployments (for example, compute layer, data
  layer)
- SLAs
- Replication and failover methods for stateful services
- Techniques to achieve high availability (for example, Multi-AZ, multi-Region)
  Skills in:
- Translating business requirements into technical resiliency needs
- Identifying and remediating single points of failure in existing workloads
- Enabling cross-Region solutions where available (for example, Amazon
  DynamoDB, Amazon RDS, Amazon Route 53, Amazon S3, Amazon
  CloudFront)
- Configuring load balancing to support cross-AZ services
- Configuring applications and related services to support multiple
  Availability Zones and Regions while minimizing downtime

### Task Statement 3.2: Implement solutions that are scalable to meet business
requirements.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Appropriate metrics for scaling services
- Loosely coupled and distributed architectures
- Serverless architectures
- Container platforms

```
Skills in:
```

- Identifying and remediating scaling issues
- Identifying and implementing appropriate auto scaling, load balancing, and
  caching solutions
- Deploying container-based applications (for example, Amazon ECS, Amazon
  EKS)
- Deploying workloads in multiple Regions for global scalability
- Configuring serverless applications (for example, Amazon API Gateway,
  Lambda, AWS Fargate)

### Task Statement 3.3: Implement automated recovery processes to meet RTO and RPO
requirements.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Disaster recovery concepts (for example, RTO, RPO)
- Backup and recovery strategies (for example, pilot light, warm standby)
- Recovery procedures

```
Skills in:
```

- Testing failover of Multi-AZ and multi-Region workloads (for example,
  Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Route 53, CloudFront)
- Identifying and implementing appropriate cross-Region backup and
  recovery strategies (for example, AWS Backup, Amazon S3, Systems
  Manager)
- Configuring a load balancer to recover from backend failure
