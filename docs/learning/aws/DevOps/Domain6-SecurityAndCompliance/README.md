**Domain 6 : Security and Compliance**

### Task Statement 6 .1: Implement techniques for identity and access management at
scale.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Appropriate usage of different IAM entities for human and machine access
  (for example, users, groups, roles, identity providers, identity-based policies,
  resource-based policies, session policies)
- Identity federation techniques (for example, using IAM identity providers
  and AWS IAM Identity Center)
- Permission management delegation by using IAM permissions boundaries
- Organizational SCPs

```
Skills in:
```

- Designing policies to enforce least privilege access
- Implementing role-based and attribute-based access control patterns
- Automating credential rotation for machine identities (for example, Secrets
  Manager)
- Managing permissions to control access to human and machine identities
  (for example, enabling multi-factor authentication [MFA], AWS Security
  Token Service [AWS STS], IAM profiles)

### Task Statement 6 .2: Apply automation for security controls and data protection.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Network security components (for example, security groups, network ACLs,
  routing, AWS Network Firewall, AWS WAF, AWS Shield)
- Certificates and public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Data management (for example, data classification, encryption, key
  management, access controls)

```
Skills in:
```

- Automating the application of security controls in multi-account and
  multi-Region environments (for example, Security Hub, Organizations, AWS
  Control Tower, Systems Manager)
- Combining security controls to apply defense in depth (for example, AWS
  Certificate Manager [ACM], AWS WAF, AWS Config, AWS Config rules,
  Security Hub, GuardDuty, security groups, network ACLs, Amazon Detective,
  Network Firewall)
- Automating the discovery of sensitive data at scale (for example, Amazon
  Macie)
- Encrypting data in transit and data at rest (for example, AWS KMS, AWS
  CloudHSM, ACM)

### Task Statement 6 .3: Implement security monitoring and auditing solutions.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Security auditing services and features (for example, CloudTrail, AWS
  Config, VPC Flow Logs, CloudFormation drift detection)
- AWS services for identifying security vulnerabilities and events (for
  example, GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, IAM Access Analyzer, AWS Config)
- Common cloud security threats (for example, insecure web traffic, exposed
  AWS access keys, S3 buckets with public access enabled or encryption
  disabled)

```
Skills in:
```

- Implementing robust security auditing
- Configuring alerting based on unexpected or anomalous security events
- Configuring service and application logging (for example, CloudTrail,
  CloudWatch Logs)
- Analyzing logs, metrics, and security findings
