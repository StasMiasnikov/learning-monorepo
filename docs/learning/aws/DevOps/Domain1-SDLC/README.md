Task Statement 1.1: Implement CI/CD pipelines.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Software development lifecycle (SDLC) concepts, phases, and models
- Pipeline deployment patterns for single-and multi-account environments

```
Skills in:
```

- Configuring code, image, and artifact repositories
- Using version control to integrate pipelines with application environments
- Setting up build processes (for example, AWS CodeBuild)
- Managing build and deployment secrets (for example, AWS Secrets
  Manager, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store)
- Determining appropriate deployment strategies (for example, AWS
  CodeDeploy)

Task Statement 1.2: Integrate automated testing into CI/CD pipelines.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Different types of tests (for example, unit tests, integration tests,
  acceptance tests, user interface tests, security scans)
- Reasonable use of different types of tests at different stages of the CI/CD
  pipeline

```
Skills in:
```

- Running builds or tests when generating pull requests or code merges (for
  example, CodeBuild)
- Running load/stress tests, performance benchmarking, and application
  testing at scale
- Measuring application health based on application exit codes
- Automating unit tests and code coverage
- Invoking AWS services in a pipeline for testing

Task Statement 1.3: Build and manage artifacts.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Artifact use cases and secure management
- Methods to create and generate artifacts
- Artifact lifecycle considerations

```
Skills in:
```

- Creating and configuring artifact repositories (for example, AWS
  CodeArtifact, Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Container Registry [Amazon ECR])
- Configuring build tools for generating artifacts (for example, CodeBuild,
  AWS Lambda)
- Automating Amazon EC2 instance and container image build processes (for
  example, EC2 Image Builder)

Task Statement 1. 4 : Implement deployment strategies for instance, container, and
serverless environments.

```
Knowledge of:
```

- Deployment methodologies for various platforms (for example, Amazon
  EC2, Amazon Elastic Container Service [Amazon ECS], Amazon Elastic
  Kubernetes Service [Amazon EKS], Lambda)
- Application storage patterns (for example, Amazon Elastic File System
  [Amazon EFS], Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Block Store [Amazon EBS])
- Mutable deployment patterns in contrast to immutable deployment
  patterns
- Tools and services available for distributing code (for example, CodeDeploy,
  EC2 Image Builder)

```
Skills in:
```

- Configuring security permissions to allow access to artifact repositories (for
  example, AWS Identity and Access Management [IAM], CodeArtifact)
- Configuring deployment agents (for example, CodeDeploy agent)
- Troubleshooting deployment issues
- Using different deployment methods (for example, blue/green, canary)
