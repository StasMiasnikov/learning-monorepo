For mastering Kubernetes internals, multi-cluster management, and performance tuning.

1. Kubernetes API Internals & etcd Deep Dive
   • Understand the API server internals, request processing, API aggregation, and optimizing etcd performance.
2. Multi-Cluster & Hybrid Deployments
   • Manage workloads across clusters using Federation (KubeFed), Cluster API, and hybrid solutions like Anthos.
3. Custom Kubernetes Controllers & Webhooks
   • Build advanced Kubernetes controllers and admission webhooks for real-time automation and policy enforcement.
4. Kubernetes Performance Optimization
   • Tune Kubernetes for large-scale workloads by optimizing scheduling, node resource allocation, and API server
   performance.
5. Advanced Kubernetes Security
   • Implement zero-trust security, encrypted communication, runtime security, and vulnerability scanning with tools
   like Trivy and Falco.
6. Kubernetes Edge Computing (K3s, KubeEdge, MicroK8s)
   • Deploy Kubernetes at the edge with lightweight distributions like K3s and KubeEdge.
7. Kubernetes-based Serverless Architectures (Knative, OpenFaaS)
   • Build scalable, event-driven workloads using Knative or OpenFaaS on Kubernetes.
8. Kubernetes Chaos Engineering (LitmusChaos, Chaos Mesh)
   • Simulate failures and improve system resilience with chaos engineering tools.
9. Kubernetes Debugging & Troubleshooting at Scale
   • Debug complex production issues using kubectl debugging tools, logs, and tracing techniques.
10. Kubernetes for High Performance Computing (HPC)
    Run AI/ML, GPU workloads, and large-scale computations efficiently in Kubernetes.
