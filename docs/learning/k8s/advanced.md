1. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) & Operators
   • Extend Kubernetes API with custom resources to manage complex applications. Operators use CRDs and controllers to
   automate operational tasks.
2. Kubernetes API Server & Admission Controllers
   • Learn about API server internals, authentication, authorization, and dynamic admission controllers for policy
   enforcement.
3. Multi-Tenancy in Kubernetes
   • Strategies for isolating workloads across teams/namespaces using RBAC, network policies, and resource quotas.
4. Kubernetes Scheduling & Custom Schedulers
   • Understand pod scheduling, affinity/anti-affinity, taints/tolerations, and how to create custom schedulers.
5. Kubernetes Security & Pod Security Standards
   • Implement RBAC, Pod Security Policies (deprecated) or Pod Security Admission, Seccomp, AppArmor, and runtime
   security tools like Falco.
6. Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd, Cilium)
   • Enhance networking with service discovery, traffic shaping, observability, and security between microservices.
7. Kubernetes Networking (CNI, Network Policies, eBPF)
   • Learn about CNI plugins (Calico, Cilium), Kubernetes DNS, ingress controllers, and network policies for security.
8. Persistent Storage & CSI (Container Storage Interface)
   • Understand stateful applications, dynamic provisioning, volume snapshots, and distributed storage options like
   Rook/Ceph.
9. Kubernetes Autoscaling (HPA, VPA, KEDA)
   • Scale workloads dynamically using CPU/memory metrics (HPA), advanced scaling with KEDA, and resource
   recommendations with VPA.
10. Observability: Logging, Monitoring & Tracing
    • Use Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, OpenTelemetry, and Fluentd for full-stack observability and distributed tracing.
11. Multi-Cluster & Hybrid Deployments (KubeFed, Cluster API, Anthos)
    • Manage workloads across multiple clusters using Federation, Cluster API, or cloud-native hybrid solutions.
12. Kubernetes Performance Optimization
    • Tuning etcd, optimizing scheduling, reducing API server load, and tweaking resource requests/limits for
    efficiency.
13. Kubernetes Policy Enforcement (OPA/Gatekeeper, Kyverno)
    • Enforce security and compliance policies using Open Policy Agent (OPA) or Kyverno.
14. GitOps with ArgoCD & Flux
    • Implement declarative CI/CD with GitOps tools like ArgoCD and Flux for continuous deployment.
15. Serverless Kubernetes (Knative, OpenFaaS)
    • Run event-driven serverless workloads on Kubernetes with Knative or OpenFaaS.
16. Kubernetes API Extensions & Webhooks
    • Develop mutating and validating admission webhooks for custom automation and policy enforcement.
17. Kubernetes Disaster Recovery & Backup Strategies
    • Implement Velero for backups, high availability etcd, and disaster recovery planning.
18. Kubernetes Edge Computing (K3s, KubeEdge)
    Deploy Kubernetes on lightweight edge devices with K3s or KubeEdge.
