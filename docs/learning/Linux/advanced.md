Focuses on system performance, security, networking, and automation.

1. Linux Filesystem & Storage Management
   • LVM (Logical Volume Manager), RAID configurations, filesystem tuning (ext4, XFS, Btrfs), and quotas.
2. Linux Networking Advanced Concepts
   • IPTables, nftables, firewalld, network namespaces, VLANs, and advanced routing with iproute2.
3. Process & Resource Management
   • Advanced process management (nice, renice, cgroups), system resource limits (ulimit), and troubleshooting
   CPU/memory issues.
4. Kernel Tuning & Performance Optimization
   • sysctl configurations, tuning kernel parameters, optimizing I/O performance, and NUMA balancing.
5. System Security & Hardening
   • SELinux/AppArmor, Fail2ban, TCP Wrappers, securing SSH (key-based authentication, port hardening), auditing with
   auditd.
6. Linux Automation & Scripting
   • Advanced Bash scripting, system automation with Ansible/Puppet/Chef, cron jobs, and systemd timers.
7. Log Management & Analysis
   • Centralized logging with rsyslog/journald, log rotation, log forwarding, and log analysis with ELK stack.
8. Linux Containers & Virtualization
   • Deep dive into Docker, Podman, LXC/LXD, KVM/QEMU, and hypervisor performance tuning.
9. High Availability & Load Balancing
   • Implementing HAProxy, keepalived, Corosync, and Pacemaker for redundancy and failover.
10. Backup & Disaster Recovery
    Backup strategies (rsync, tar, Bacula, BorgBackup), disk imaging with dd/Clonezilla, and disaster recovery planning.
